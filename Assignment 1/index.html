                <p>I've lived in Colorado for 27 years.  I have also lived in Indiana and Texas.  Over the last two years I have been working in the field of maintenance solving different types of problems and puzzles.  I work for <a href="https://www.spectrumretirement.com/" target="_blank">Spectrum Retirement</a> as a Director of Maintenance.  I run a senior living community (from a maintenance stand point) and make sure that everything works and that the residents are happy.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Prior to that I taught Krav Maga for 5 years, which included everything from teaching one on one classes to international trainings teaching in front of groups of 100+ people.  I have two 2nd degree black belts.  The first is in <a href="https://www.premiermartialarts.com/" target="_blank">Premier Martial Arts</a> which is a Mixed Martial Arts system comprised of Krav Maga, Mauy Thai, American Kickboxing, and Brazillian Jui Jitsu. The second is in <a href="http://www.kukkiwon.or.kr/front/pageView.action?cmd=/eng/introduce/introduce" target="_blank">Kukkiwon</a>, a Korean governed body of Tae Kwon Do.  I hold rank in six martial arts systems total.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>I am extremely hard working and I care greatly about impacting the surrounding community for the better with my daily actions.  My core values are honesty and integrity above all else.  They are my guiding principles in both work and life.  I strive to produce high quality results that I can be proud of in everything I do.</p>
                <p>I have skill sets in varying backgrounds, including; IT, retail, HVAC, Customer Service, Landscaping, etc., which contributes to my ability to adapt quickly to new situations. I also have experience managing other employees and large groups of individuals.</p>
                    <br>
                <p>I believe that no challenge is too small and no puzzle is unsolvable.</p>
