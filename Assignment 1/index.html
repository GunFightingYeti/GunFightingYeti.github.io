                <p>I've lived in Colorado for 27 years  I have also lived in Indiana and Texas.</p>
                <p>Over the last two years I have been working in the field of maintenance solving different types of puzzles.  Prior to that I taught Krav Maga for 5 years which included everything from teaching one on one classes to international trainings teaching in front of groups of 100+ people.</p>
                <p>I am extremely hard working and I care greatly about impacting the surrounding community for the better with my daily actions.  My core values are honesty and integrity above all else.  They are my guiding principles in both work and life.  I strive to produce high quality results that I can be proud of in everything I do.</p>
                <p>I have skill sets in varying backgrounds which contributes to my ability to adapt quickly. I also have experience managing other employees and large groups of individuals.</p>
                <p>I believe that no challenge is too small and no puzzle is unsolvable.</p>
