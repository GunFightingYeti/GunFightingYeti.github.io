## Here's how the program works

### Press a button!

#### After landing on the home page you need to be decisive and click the "Take the Quiz" button.  Otherwise, you're not cut out to be a Guardian.  They need to be able to press button when the time comes.

#### If you've summoned up the courage to join the Guardians and pressed a single button then you've passed!  You're well on your way to being compare to someone else.  You'll be directed to page two, where the magic really happens.
