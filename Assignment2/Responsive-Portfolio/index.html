            <p>I have lived in Colorado for 27 years and have also spent time in Indiana and Texas. Over the last two years
                I have been working in the field of maintenance solving different types of problems and puzzles. Working
                for
                <a href="https://www.spectrumretirement.com/" target="_blank">Spectrum Retirement</a> as a Director of Maintenance, the focus is on running a senior living community (from
                a maintenance stand point) and making sure that everything works and the residents are happy.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Prior to that, as a Krav Maga instructor for 5 years, the job included everything from teaching one on one classes
                to international trainings instructing groups of 100+ people. I hold two 2nd degree black belts. The first
                is in
                <a href="https://www.premiermartialarts.com/" target="_blank">Premier Martial Arts</a> which is a Mixed Martial Arts system comprised of Krav Maga, Muay Thai, American
                Kickboxing, and Brazillian Jui Jitsu. The second is in
                <a href="http://www.kukkiwon.or.kr/front/pageView.action?cmd=/eng/introduce/introduce" target="_blank">Kukkiwon</a>, a Korean governed body of Tae Kwon Do. Since 2001, training in multiple systems, I have earned
                rank in six martial arts total.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I am extremely hard working and care greatly about impacting the surrounding community for the better with my
                daily actions. My core values are honesty and integrity above all else and are the guiding principles in
                my work and life. I strive to produce high quality results of which to be proud.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Skill sets in varying backgrounds, including; IT, Retail, Construction, Customer Service, Landscaping, Teaching
                and Managing other employees contributes to my ability to adapt quickly. No challenge is too small and no
                puzzle is unsolvable</p>
