                    <p>I have lived in Colorado for 27 years and have also spent time in Indiana and Texas. Over the last two
                        years I have been working in the field of maintenance solving different types of problems and puzzles.
                        Working for
                        <a href="https://www.spectrumretirement.com/" target="_blank">Spectrum Retirement</a> as a Director of Maintenance, the focus is on running a senior living community
                        (from a maintenance stand point) and making sure that everything works and the residents are happy.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Prior to that, as a Krav Maga instructor for 5 years, the job included everything from teaching one on
                        one classes to international trainings instructing groups of 100+ people. I hold two 2nd degree black
                        belts. The first is in
                        <a href="https://www.premiermartialarts.com/" target="_blank">Premier Martial Arts</a> which is a Mixed Martial Arts system comprised of Krav Maga, Muay Thai,
                        American Kickboxing, and Brazillian Jui Jitsu. The second is in

                        have earned rank in six martial arts total.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I am extremely hard working and care greatly about impacting the surrounding community for the better
                        with my daily actions. My core values are honesty and integrity above all else and are the guiding
                        principles in my work and life. I strive to produce high quality results of which to be proud.</p>
                    <br>

                        Teaching and Managing other employees contributes to my ability to adapt quickly. No challenge is
                        too small and no puzzle is unsolvable</p>
